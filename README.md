# Audio Branch

## About

An audio-reactive visualization that attempts to capture sound with motion. It takes audio input from the microphone whose amplitude is then registered. This amplitude then influences the snake-like motion of these creatures in a psuedo random fashion.

## Usage

To be able to run this program you'll have to click on the screen once everytime you run it to enable your microphone input.
